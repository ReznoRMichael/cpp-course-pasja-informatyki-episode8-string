## General info
The basics of `string` class. Create a `string` and then ask the user to type his/her name, save it to the array. Then count the array length with the function `length()`, save it into an `int` variable. If the last element in the `string` array is the letter 'a' the program outputs that the user might be a woman. If not, the program outputs that the user is probably a man.
